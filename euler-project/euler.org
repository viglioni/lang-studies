** TODO Even Fibonacci numbers
   Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

   1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

   By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
** TODO Largest prime factor
   The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

   What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
** TODO Largest palindrome product
   A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

   Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
** TODO Smallest multiple
   2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

   What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
** TODO Sum square difference
   The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

   The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is (1 + ... + 10)^2 = 3025

   Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

   Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
** TODO 10001st prime
   By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

   What is the 10 001st prime number?
** TODO Largest product in a series
   The four adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product are 9 × 9 × 8 × 9 = 5832.
